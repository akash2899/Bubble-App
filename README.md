# Bubble-App
We have developed a simple yet engaging interactive web application using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The application features four colorful bubbles on the left side of the screen, each paired with an arrow on the right. When a user clicks on a bubble, the corresponding arrow smoothly moves toward it, simulating a shooting effect.
When you click on any circle, the arrow to the corresponding arrow start moving towards the circle & hit it.
Color of the circle should change once the arrow hits them.
Add a reset button that resets the application to its initial state.
