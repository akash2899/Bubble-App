# Bubble-App
We have developed a simple yet engaging interactive web application using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The application features four colorful bubbles on the left side of the screen, each paired with an arrow on the right. When a user clicks on a bubble, the corresponding arrow smoothly moves toward it, simulating a shooting effect.
